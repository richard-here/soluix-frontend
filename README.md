# Setup Instructions

Before running the frontend app locally, make sure that the backend service is already running on the local machine. Instructions on running the backend app can be seen in the README file in this repository: https://github.com/richard-here/soluix-backend.

After running the backend service in the local machine, simply run the frontend app using this command in the terminal.
```
npm run start
```

**Note**
- UIs are partially done. Some UIs (e.g. dialogs when clicking button) are still not finished.
- Fetching API mechanisms are partially done. At this point, the only API fetching that works is getting product list with `page` as query parameter.
